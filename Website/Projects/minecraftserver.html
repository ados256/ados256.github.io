	<h2 class="paragraphheader">Summary	</h2>
	<p class="content">
	The goal of this project was to activate and manage a multiplayer server for the game Minecraft. This game is essentially a sandbox style building game with survival elements. The programming of the server is excessively easy
	since the application is downloadable from the web. With basic networking knowledge (port-forwarding) the server can be opened up to the internet and many players can cooperate in the same world. What was interesting about
	this project is the project-management aspect. Coordinating resource management and building schedules was of prime importance. For example, it was important to gather stone and build defence walls before building aesthetic 
	elements like fountains.<br><br>
	To learn more and understand about the educational value of Minecraft I highly recommend watching this short video.
